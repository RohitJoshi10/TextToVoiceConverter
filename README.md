# TextToVoiceConverter


# *In this website we can convert a given text into speech.*
Here, We have different voices also and we can also change the pitch,loudness of the voice also. 
# Languages used:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
We have used two interfaces to convert text to speech:
SpeechSynthesisUtterance has data of what text to be spoken and how it should be spoken(speed, pitch, lang, and voice).
SpeechSynthesis can be used to retrieve information about voices available on the device, start and pause speech, etc.
